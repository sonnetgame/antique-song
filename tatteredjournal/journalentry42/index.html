                    <p>Dreadful hangover today.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>And to make matters worse, It’s become abundantly clear</p>
                    <p>that the girl has gone into the Flats for Cloudwater.</p>
                    <p>How naive.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I had hoped she would have just left her bloom with the old man for safekeeping,</p>
                    <p>but she brought it with her.</p>
                    <p>Likely out of an abundance of caution after our last encounter.</p>
                    <p>Warranted, I suppose.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I don’t know what sounds worse right now, sitting here all day waiting for her to return,</p>
                    <p>or following her into the Flats and chancing an interaction with that insolent thrift store matron. </p>
                    <p>Maybe it’s just my headache talking but I think if I had to hold a conversation</p>
                    <p>with that woman right now I might actually murder her. And her damn birds.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>And to add even more to my annoyances, it’s supposed to rain here today!</p>
                    <p>It hasn’t rained here in 4 years! Just as I left the rain, it followed me here.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Clover would laugh and say that's karma.</p>
                    <p>Maybe when I get back, I'll have to murder him too.</p>
                    <br><br>
