                <p>Busy morning.</p>
                <p>We ran into a lost pilgrim in the woods near Lake Astre.</p>
                <p>He fought back. I would have too.</p>
                <p>I cut his bloom while the others stood guard.</p>
                <p>One day he’ll realize we did him a favor.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Clover caught wind of another party that’s headed out west towards the greater plateaus, a young woman and an old man.</p>
                <p>The plan is for me to split off from the others to track them while the rest of our group patrols the south.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Not looking forward to the heat, but at least I’ll be done with this insipid rain for a while.</p>
