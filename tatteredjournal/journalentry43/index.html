                    <p>Dreadful hangover today.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>i needed the extra sleep, but i just found out that the girl</p>
                    <p>left earlier this morning alone and headed into the flats for cloudwater.</p>
                    <p>who knows w<span class="secret">h</span>ere she got that idea from.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>wish she had just left her bloom with the old man for safekeeping.</p>
                    <p>this would be a whole lot e<span class="secret">a</span>sier.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>it's fine</p>
                    <p>can't say i blame her for keeping it close</p>
                    <p>after our last encounter</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>though i don’t know what soun<span class="secret">d</span>s worse right now, sitting here all day waiting for her to return,</p>
                    <p>or following her into the flats and chancing an interaction with that unbearable thrift store matron. </p>
                    <p>maybe it’s just my headache talking but i think if i had to hear any more</p>
                    <p>of that lady's grievances, i might actually scr<span class="secret">e</span>am at her this time. and her damn birds.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>and to make matters worse, it’s supposed to rain here today!</p>
                    <p>it hasn’t rained here in---</p>
