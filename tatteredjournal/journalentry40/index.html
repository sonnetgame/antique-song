                    <p>Slight detour today</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>before i split off from the others, gerrick suggested paying a visit to his cousin.</p>
                    <p>she maintains a fire watcht<span class="secret">o</span>wer out here and is sympathetic to our cause.</p>
                    <p>i'm grateful for the safe place to rest.</p>
                    <!-- <p>as we head farther towards the coast, those will be much harder to come by.</p> -->
                    <br>
                    <p>we ended up chatting for a while, and i learned about her part-time wo<span class="secret">r</span>k as an archivist of dreams.</p>
                    <p>she's been comparing regional accounts and trying to determine whether</p>
                    <p>there's a connective thread between w<span class="secret">h</span>at different people imagine in their sleep.</p>
                    <p>her walls are covered with colorful sketches and letters that people have sent in over the years.</p>
                    <p>fascinating stuff.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>i asked if she's ever considered joining us,</p>
                    <p>as i imagine the travels would be helpful for her research.</p>
                    <p>she said it crossed her mind, but the wooded isolation of the tower is cruci<span class="secret">a</span>l to her work.</p>
                    <p>she wouldn't tell me why though.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>such a different life</p>
                    <p>i wish i could stay still that long</p>
